## General Information
A US-based housing company called Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
The company is looking for potential sales targets to enter the market.
- What variables are important in predicting property prices that will benefit the company? - How well do these variables explain house prices?



## Conclusions
- Based on the requirement, the corporation should concentrate more on the negative aspects and focus on buying homes below market value.
They can increase the aforementioned variables and discuss the highly regarded positive variables to increase revenues.
- The SalePrice is heavily influenced by the square feet of above-grade (ground) living space.
- Basement and external quality that is good and great is better sold
- Because there is less demand for housing in Northridge, Northridge Heights, and Stone Brook, it sells there more slowly and for less money.
- The ideal value for lambda in ridge regression is -9, while the ideal value in lasso regression is 100.
